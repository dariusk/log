#### Vaccine-related tweets tagged by ML classifier as pro-vax or anti-vax
#### Botometer with 0.5 threshold (really low imo!) used to identify bots
##### bots are probably OVER-identified and yet still the bot exposure was minimal
#### #Quotes
##### "Exposure to bots was rare and unevenly distributed across users (Figure 2); 42.0% of users may have been exposed at least once to a vaccine-related tweet originally posted by a bot, because either they followed a bot account that posted a vaccine-related tweet or an account they followed retweeted a vaccine-related tweet posted by a bot account. However, posts from bots made up a small percentage of vaccine-related exposures; the median percentage of exposures originating from bots was 0.0% (IQR = 0.0%–0.5%). Bot accounts were responsible for at least half of the potential exposures to vaccine-related tweets for less than 0.06% of users"
